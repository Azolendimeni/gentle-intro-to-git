# A gentle introduction to Git

This is the practice repository for https://curiousprogrammer.dev/courses/git.

To generate official Git documentation pages, use the following command:

```bash
git help git-tag >> git-tag.txt
```

Replace the `tag` with the name of the command you want to export to a text file.

Happy versioning!
